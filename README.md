ABOUT US
We specialize in creating custom gowns, designed by our customers. We assist our customers in designing gowns that are unique and ideal to each customer's vision. Our goal is to make each of our customer's weddings even more amazing by giving them the opportunity to have a dress that is everything that they had imagined. From alluring glamour to understated elegance, we can make your dream dress a reality. 

About Our Dresses
Each of our dresses is individually handcrafted and custom-made specially for each customer. Our dresses are made with the same high quality fabrics found on designer gowns.  All of our dresses are constructed with multiple layers including a soft lining, double interfacing, at least 10 boning strips and bust cups. This construction ensures that the dress has excellent structure and stays comfortably in place on the customer's body. All bead work is done by hand using Swarovski crystals and Matsuno glass beads in intricate designs. 

How The Ordering Process Works
Once you have decided on the details of your dress, send us your measurements along with only 50% of the cost of the dress. We have this low down payment so that our customers take very little risk when ordering their dress through us and can feel more comfortable about their purchase. We will then begin production of your dress, once your dress is completed we will send you pictures of your completed gown. If you are happy with the dress then you can send us the remaining 50% of the cost of your dress and we will have your dress shipped to you. If there is anything you would like changed about the dress then you can let us know, we will make the appropriate changes and send you pictures again to confirm before you pay the balance. We have this process because we are committed to being certain that every customer feels that their dress is perfect in every way. 

Terms and Conditions
Production Time: It normally takes 10 to 12 weeks to complete a dress, however, it can take up to 16 weeks depending upon the size and amount of work in the dress. We will provide all of our customers with an estimated time of completion based upon their specific dress. Please note: if you request changes to the dress, once its completed this will take additional time, possibly up to a month, depending on the type of changes. Each time changes are requested, this could require up to an additional 4 weeks. Production time begins when the down payment, measurements and all details of the order have been received and finalized. We suggest ordering a dress at least 6 months prior to your wear date. 
Shipping: All of our dresses are shipped with insurance covering the entire cost of the dress, which is included in the shipping charge. Shipping charges are $50 for the continental US. Shipping charges to other countries are usually between $70-100, exact amounts are determined by the location and weight of the dress. Please allow 10 days for a quality control check of the dress and shipping time. IMPORTANT: We cannot guarantee delivery dates, we are not in control of the postal services.
Stocking Fees: There, will be a stocking fee of $25.00  2 weeks post production. This means, we give our customers 2 weeks to pay off the balance of their dress. After this time period, we charge a $25.00 per week fee for stocking the finished dress.
Alterations: While we try our very best to make the dress fit, according to the measurements that we receive, it is not always possible to make the dress fit perfectly based on measurements alone, without having the customer present to build the dress around. Therefore, alterations may be necessary. We cannot be responsible for the cost of alterations. When buying a dress from a regular retail store, alterations will be needed and the cost may be included in the price or you may be charged extra. Our dresses are priced to leave our customers with a budget for alterations if they are needed.
